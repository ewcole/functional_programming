Motivation for Functional Programming
=====================================

Functional programming is an application of the Lambda Calculus to computer 
programming

Some Advantages of Functional Programming
-----------------------------------------
* Functional programming is theoretically sound because it is closely based on
  the Lambda Calculus, one of the two main mathematical systems that underlie
  the theory of computer science.

* Functional programming makes it easier to deal with concurrency.  Writing 
  an error-free program for a multithreaded environment is difficult, and a 
  strictly functional approach limits the interaction between parts of your 
  program.
