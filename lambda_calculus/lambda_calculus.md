The Lambda Calculus
===============================================================================
The Lambda Calculus is a mathematical theory of computation that is equivalent
to Turing's model for computable functions.  It is based on the manipulation of
_lambda expressions_, which are formally defined as a combination of the 
following things:

    * _name_
    * &lambda; _name_ . _lambda-expression_
    * (_lambda-expression_ _lambda-expression_) _lambda-expression_

The _name_ represents a unary function (i.e. a function with one argument) that 
has no side effects.
