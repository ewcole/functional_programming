These are my notes from this year's study of automata, which is an important branch of theoretical computer science.  It is surprisingly mathematical in its form and content.
* Alphabets

An alphabet \Sigma is a non-empty, finite set.

Automata theory uses linguistic terminology for its basic ideas, but an alphapet doesn't have to consist of letters.  For instance, if you consider a vending machine as an automaton, the letters are actually the different coins that the machine recognizes.

* Deterministic Finite Automata
